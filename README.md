Focus on Underperforming Regions: The South and West regions require dedicated marketing and distribution strategies. Analyze customer preferences, logistical challenges, and competition in these areas to tailor sales efforts effectively.
Strengthen High-Performing Regions: While the North and East regions are leading, efforts to deepen customer engagement and expand the market base in these regions could sustain and further boost revenue.
3. Sales Team Performance Enhancement
